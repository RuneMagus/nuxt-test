We're using Histoire to organise stories for each of our components.

Learn more about Histoire [here](https://histoire.dev/).

---

Component stories should be co-located with the components. Based on folder structure, they will automatically appear under 'Atoms', 'Molecules' or 'Others'.

For a basic example of a story showing just one variant of a component, check out ModalComponent. The minimum needed is adding your `.story.vue` file, and wrapping your component in a `<Story>` tag.

If your component has multiple variants, you can use `<Variant>` to display them all without having to edit props manually in the Controls tab at runtime - see the [docs on writing stories](https://histoire.dev/guide/vue3/stories.html#variants).
